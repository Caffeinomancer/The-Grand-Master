**Aesthetics-Intelligence-Armor**
I would like something stylish to protect my ribs. Something Ronevan perhaps. I am out troll hunting today and I need a solid plate to stop their clubs.
I would love something with nice silvered rings. I am scouring the countryside for bandits for Farmer Hus and I need a new suit of maille. Anything of the sorta will do though.
Something solid and platelike. I found worm-sign nearby and I am going to want some armor to make me a bit less digestible.
I would like a princely looking suit of fire-resistant armor. I have been hunting Lava Worms and I want something to keep me from melting. Well, fire-resistant preferably but anything would be better then what I have got.
