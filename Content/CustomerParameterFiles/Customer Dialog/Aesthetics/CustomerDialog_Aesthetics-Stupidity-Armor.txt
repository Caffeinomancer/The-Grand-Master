**Aesthetics-Stupidity-Armor**
I would like something in style. Ronevan maybe. Seems right for spring  I am going to need to look pretty to fight the trolls outbreak.  Why are you looking at me like that?
I would love something with nice silver inlays. They say silver hurts monsters more. They were at the bar getting wasted but their advice holds I bet!
Something to match my pants would be spectacular. Fashion is the utmost priority for any adventurer.
I would like a princely looking suit of maille. Afterall, fashion is the utmost priority for any adventurer.
I just want something with nice gilded plates.Gold is heavy right? It will stop a sword cold!
