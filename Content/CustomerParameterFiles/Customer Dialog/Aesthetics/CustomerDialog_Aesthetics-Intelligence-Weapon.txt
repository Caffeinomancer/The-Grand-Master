**Aesthetics-Intelligence-Weapon**
I am looking for something sharp with a curve. Something Byzhan maybe? Something made of folded steel?
I need a classical looking weapon. Something Varag.  An axe? A sword?  Some pattern welded iron would be good.
Do you have a runesword in stock? Or an ivory-shafted spear?  Anything that can stop a troll is good by me.
I need a weapon to wear in Roneva. Something really impressive to show my…stature. It needs to impress the city founders.
