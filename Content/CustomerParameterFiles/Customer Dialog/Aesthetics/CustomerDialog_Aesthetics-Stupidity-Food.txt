I need a nice red apple. Or a blue berry. Or...really anything vivid. Surprise me! I need some browned meat. You left them out for a few days right?
I would like some nice golden beer. Something with a nice look or fizz. Preferably deadly!
I could use a big blackened, roasted hunk of meat. I expect your company of chefs to be up to my tastes!
You have got something with a bit of crunch for me? I will take some raw clams. Heard they are a delicacy around here!
