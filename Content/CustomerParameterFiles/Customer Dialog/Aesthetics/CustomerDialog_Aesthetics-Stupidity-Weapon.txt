**Aesthetics-Stupidity-Weapon**
I am looking for something sharp with a curve. Something Byzhan maybe? Do you have a Katana! I have heard they have the soul of a Samurai in them. I want to be a samurai too!
I need a classic looking weapon.  Something Varag. An axe? A sword? The Skoffins are out to get me I swear! I need to borrow your firelock! No? I will take anything! 
Do you have a runesword in stock?  Or an ivory-shafted spear? I saw it!  With my waking eyes I saw a wolf the size of a tree in Yhomstad. It had floppy ears and…well it may not have been as big as I thought.
I need a weapon to wear in Roneva. Something really impressive to show my…stature.  An iron greatsword maybe. That will show the ladies! What?
I lost a bet at the tavern. I got a bone to pick out. What can do some real damage?
I am looking for a weapon made with crycedium steel? Got anything like it?
