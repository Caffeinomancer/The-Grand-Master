**Intelligence-Functionality-Weapon**
I could use some Ronevan magework. They have the best damn cleavers.
I need a good Farstad giant etched steel. One of those blades could split a tree.
I could use some of that northern pattern-welded steel in my hands. One of those blades could split a tree.
A southern black blade is my preference but I understand they are hard to get. They are damn sharp blades.
