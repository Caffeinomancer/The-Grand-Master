I would like a Davanport apple or something of the like. Nice, red, and vivid.  Or anything of the like. Surprise me!
Get me some Ostmarak salted pork please. I could use a big blackened, roasted hunk of meat. Or something filling.
I require something to regain my vitality.  Something with a kick preferably. I would like some nice golden beer.  Something with a nice look or fizz.
I need a good dinner. Something with spices from the lands south of the waste. You’ve got something with a bit of crunch for me?
