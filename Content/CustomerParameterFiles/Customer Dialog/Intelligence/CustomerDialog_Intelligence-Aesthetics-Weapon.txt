**Intelligence-Aesthetics-Weapon**
I could use some Ronevan magework  Some enchanted steel.
I need good Farstad giant etched steelwork.  They are gourgeous.
I could use some of that northern pattern-welded steel in my hands.
A southern black blade is my preference but I understand they are hard to get.
