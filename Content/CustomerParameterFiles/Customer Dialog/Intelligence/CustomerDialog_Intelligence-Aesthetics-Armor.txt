**Intelligence-Aesthetics-Armor**
I am out troll hunting today and I need a solid plate to stop their clubs.  Something stylish perhaps?  Something Ronevan perhaps.  
I am scouring the countryside for bandits for Farmer Hus and I need a new suit of maille. I’d love something with nice silvered rings.
I found worm-sign nearby and I’m going to want some armor to make me a bit less digestible. Something to match my pants would be spectacular.
I’ve been hunting Lava Worms and I want something to keep me from melting.  Fire-resistant preferably but anything would be better then what I’ve got. I would like a princely looking suit of maille.
