**Intelligence-Functionality-Armor**
I am out troll hunting today and I need a solid plate to stop their clubs. A wee little trolling was spotted near town.  I would like something that their clubs will bounce off of.
I am scouring the countryside for bandits for Farmer Hus and I need a new suit of maille. I just want to stop the knife of a godless wretch.
I found worm-sign nearby and I am going to want some armor to make me a bit less digestible. They keep making their way out of the wastes. I might need some maille to feel safe when I’m about town.
I have been hunting Lava Worms and I want something to keep me from melting.  Fire-resistant preferably but anything would be better then what I have got. Whatever you have will suffice.
I would like to gift a new set of armor or gear to my cousin in Pyren Farsted. Something sturdy and durable.
