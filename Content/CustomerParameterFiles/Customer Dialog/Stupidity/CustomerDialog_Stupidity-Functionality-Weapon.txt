**Stupidity-Functionality-Weapon**
The Skoffins are out to get me I swear!  I need to borrow your firelock! No? I will take anything! You have some sharpened steel for me?
Do you have a Katana! I have heard they have the soul of a Samurai in them. I want to be a samurai too! Any good side-arm for the road to the Byzhan Valley? Any weapon will do, I suppose.
I saw it! With my waking eyes I saw a wolf the size of a tree in Yhomstad. It had floppy ears and…well it may not have been as big as I thought.  Got something to spear Asena the Wise Wolf with?
