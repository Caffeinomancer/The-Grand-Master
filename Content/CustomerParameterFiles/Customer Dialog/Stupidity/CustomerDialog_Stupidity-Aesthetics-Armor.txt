**Stupidity-Aesthetics-Armor**
I want something to stop the teeth of a dragon. Those exist right? I’d like something in style. Ronevan maybe. Seems right for spring.
I swear I saw a wight the other day. I mean, it was lying on the ground limply, but I swear I saw it twitch! I need some armor.  I would love something with nice silver inlays. 
There are mud-crabs by the water and I don’t know how strong their claws are.  Do you think full plate will be enough? Something to match my pants would be spectacular.
There was a rat in basement! It might try to eat me in my sleep! I need a good suit of mail to sleep in! A princely looking suit of maille.
