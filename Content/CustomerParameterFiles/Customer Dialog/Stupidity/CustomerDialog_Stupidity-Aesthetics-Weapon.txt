**Stupidity-Aesthetics-Weapon**
Do you have a Katana! I have heard they have the soul of a Samurai in them. I want to be a samurai too! Something curved and Byzhan maybe?
The Skoffins are out to get me I swear! I need to borrow your firelock!  No? I’ll take anything!  Oh very well. I will have your best looking spear then.
I saw it! With my waking eyes I saw a wolf the size of a tree in Yhomstad. It had floppy ears and...well it may not have been as big as I thought. I still want something elegant and light just in case it shows in town again!
