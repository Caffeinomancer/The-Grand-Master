I expect your company of chefs to be up to my tastes! I need a nice red apple. Or a blue berry. Or...really anything vivid. Surprise me!
I will take some raw clams. Heard they are a delicacy around here! You’ve got something with a bit of crunch for me?
I need some browned meat. You left them out for a few days right? I could use a brown, bloody hunk of meat.
I would like some tuna. Or chicken. I get them confused sometimes. You’ve got something with a bit of crunch for me?
