**Stupidity-Functionality-Armor**
I want something to stop the teeth of a dragon. Those exist right? I just want to stop the knife of a godless wretch.
I swear I saw a wight the other day. I mean, it was lying on the ground limply, but I swear I saw it twitch! I need some armor. I will feel safe when I am about town in some steel.
I saw it! With my waking eyes I saw a wolf the size of a tree in Yhomstad.  It had floppy ears and…well it may not have been as big as I thought. But wolves are getting close to Yhomstad tonight and I would like to keep their teeth out of my neck. Got anything for that?
I need something...what do they call it...armor! Yngvar wants me to join the garrison and he said I need something nice and padded.  I think.
