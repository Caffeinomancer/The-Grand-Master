I need something fat and greasy. Nice, filling and healthy!
Grandmaster I need a drink of wine. I heard that you have some. What do you mean grapes don't grow this far north?
Grandmaster I'm starving! Get me a piece of troll. You cook that right?
I will have some snails! You can find those anywhere so they will be in stock I bet. No? Anything will do I guess.
