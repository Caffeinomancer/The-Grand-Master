**Functionality-Intelligence-Armor**
I just want to stop the knife of a godless wretch. I am scouring the countryside for bandits for Farmer Hus and I need a new suit of maille.
Those Varags on the shore are making me nervous.  I might need some maille to feel safe when I am about town. 
Wolves are getting close to Yhomstad tonight and I prefer to keep their teeth out of my neck.  Got anything for that?
A wee little trolling was spotted near town.  I’d like something that their clubs will bounce off of and I am going to need a solid plate to stop their clubs.
Yngvar wants me to join the garrison and he said I need something nice and padded.  I don't care its pretty just that its made of some fine southron steel and not the skite local stuff.
Wolves are getting close to Yhomstad at night and I would like to keep their teeth out of my neck.I am going to want some armor to make me a bit less digestible.
