**Functionality-Stupidity-Weapon**
Any good side-arm for the road to the Byzhan Valley? Any weapon will do, I suppose. Do you have a Katana!  I have heard they have the soul of a Samurai in them.  I want to be a samurai too!
You have some sharpened steel for me? The Skoffins are out to get me I swear!  I need to borrow your firelock! No?  I will take anything! 
My neighbors have been acting strange recently and I’d like some steel to keep next to my bed.  The Skoffins are out to get me I swear!  I need to borrow your firelock!  No?  I’ll take anything! 
I need a spear!  A big long spear! I saw it!  With my waking eyes I saw a wolf the size of a tree in Yhomstad.  It had floppy ears and…well it may not have been as big as I thought.
