Grand Master are there any food goods on sale? I am about to go on a pilgrimage to Byzhan Wu's resting place and it needs to last me a ways.
Damn I would love something filling right now. Get me some Ostmarak salted pork please. Or something filling.
Skite I need something in my belly.  Food, drink...anything really.  I need a good dinner.  Something with spices from the lands south of the waste. Or not. I like surprises.
I need something to give me some color in my cheeks.  I feel a bit off.  I require something to regain my vitality. Something with a kick preferably.
You should get me some cold beer or some food. I would like a Davanport apple or something of the like.
