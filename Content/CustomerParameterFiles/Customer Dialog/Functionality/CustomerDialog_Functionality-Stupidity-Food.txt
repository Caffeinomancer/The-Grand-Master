Skite I need something in my belly.  Food, drink...anything really. I’d like some tuna.  Or chicken. I get them confused sometimes.
I need something to give me some color in my cheeks.  I feel a bit off. I’ll take some raw clams. Heard they are a delicacy around here! I've been eating a ton of them!

My hunt turned out empty handed. Need something to bring home to the family.
I am extremeley famished from my travels back from the Summit. You have any grub?
