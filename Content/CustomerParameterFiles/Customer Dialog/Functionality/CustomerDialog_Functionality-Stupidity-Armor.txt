**Functionality-Stupidity-Armor**
Quickly I need some iron! I want something to stop the teeth of a dragon.  Those exist right?
I do not care what you have. Any maille is better then none! I swear I saw wight the other day. I mean, it was lying on the ground limply, but I swear I saw it twitch! I need some armor.
I could use a bit of a shell.  There are mud-crabs by the water and I don’t know how strong their claws are. Do you think full plate will be enough?
Do you have any thing thick and protective? There was a rat in basement! It might try to eat me in my sleep! I need a good suit of mail to sleep in!
