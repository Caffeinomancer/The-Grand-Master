**Functionality-Intelligence-Weapon**
You have some sharpened steel for me?  Some imported Ronevan stuff maybe. That will do the trick.
My neighbors have been acting strange recently and I would like some steel to keep next to my bed. If you could get me something light like a Corsair's weapon, that would be great.
Any good side-arm for the road to the Byzhan Valley? Any weapon will do, I suppose.  If it could have a good forward cutting balance, I would like that a lot.
Got something to club a bandit with? If you can get me some folded steel that would be amazing.
