*Encounter 1*
Hmmm... it does not look like you really sell materials, like uh... gunpowder, or anything. I've been lacking a piece to wear for protection. That reminds me! Where did you get that halberd? Only Byzhan works with gunpowder.
*Encounter 2*
Agh! I keep forgetting you don not sell any explosive halberds. I guess I will buy something else. 
*Encounter 3*
I know I keep asking about your weapon, but I swear this time I am looking for my own. Even if it is not your explosive halberd. So, Grand Master, I wanted to tell you that I do not care how you got that halberd.
