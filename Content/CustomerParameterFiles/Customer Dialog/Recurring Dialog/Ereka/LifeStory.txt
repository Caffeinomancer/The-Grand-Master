Well, this isn't a very neighborly thing to ask for but I need a weapon.  I am new here and I'm not always welcomed. With with those oathbreaking Argrvandr Pirates down the coast...
Thank you, Grandmaster. It's good to speak in my tongue, even if it's just a word  A Great Host of Argar has just returned from Byzhan and my kinsmen settling in the east are worried that they will some turn their swords on their own kin. 
Grandmaster, I need some supplies.  My kinsmen did not bring any to the warparty and we need them now.
