While you are at it, there's something I need.  My men and women at the garrison at Farstad need weapons and I need them for cheap.
You've been doing well for yourself. I could use some more supplies for the Pyren Garrison.
I'm also going to need one of your famous wares!  My boys at the garrison love the food, armor, and weapons. Especially Loric. Keeps send people your way.
I need a backup weapon. The world is dangerous with all monsters returning and the Argvandr becoming bolder.
Loric had one job. One job! Sharpen my sword and now it's ruined. I'm hoping I can find a replacement or an equivalent.
That Perkele Loric lost his weapon during a training skirmish. Elder Grundy's prices are a little high. Hopefully you can give me a good deal.
