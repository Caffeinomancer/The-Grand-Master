*Encounter 1*
I am Dargo Milos and very happy you asked! What is yours sir? So I was hungry and wondering what sort of food you had here? Your biggest and best thing on the menu!
*Encounter 2*
I need to buy a weapon for a friend, so what do you have? Surely they will appreciate this. My poor friend is in trouble with some Godless Wretches. They have no money and... well... I have more than enough.
*Encounter 3*
I had a bet the other day with a friend. If I lost, I would have to spend as much money as I could here... I lost! What do I want this time...
