I can't do that price.
I don't know.  Are you sure you know what you're talking about?
If you think I'm paying that...
I thought you were an adventurer.  Not a highway robber.
Erhmmmm. Can we got a bit lower?
Ooooo. That's a little too high? Don't you think?
Not even old Knarr ever charged that high.
