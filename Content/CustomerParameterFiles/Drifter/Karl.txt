Ummm...hello. Are you the Grandmaster? I'm Karl and I...uh...I'm an adventurer you see and I want to...um...work for you.
Is that so?
Aye, I've been trying to get experience adventuring but I've never really had the chance to do it, and now you've, uh, become a figment in the town and Tam said I should go for it.
I see.  Any meaningful experience?
Nothing much really. I'm just a farmer. I've actually never held a weapon. Except an axe. But it was a chopping axe...not a battle axe. I almost chopped off Tam's toes then.
So Tam put you up to this?
Yes Tam! She's my best friend, and uh, well she's always been there for me and bringing me on her adventures. At least she uh, used to.
And why would I ever consider hiring you?
Well I...look I'm not going to lie, I've never really adventured before. I'm kind of new but...look I really want to help out around here. People don't really like me and...I don't know I feel like I could actually do some good here. At least, Tam thinks I could.
Really! You won't regret this Grandmaster! I'll pull my weight and try not to mess this up!

Menda Grandmaster.  I...I just wanted to thank you. For giving me this chance.
Well, You haven't failed catastrophically yet.
Do you...have a minute?  I'd like it if you could show me some of your tricks...Tam said I needed some practice.
Of course!  If anything I can show you will keep you out of a Worm's maw. I'll do it.
Ah.  You remember that.  Well thank you.  Any advice for me going forward?
Prepare yourself before you hit a target.  Find out from the locals everything that can be used against it.
I'll keep your words in mind.  And thanks again.
Wait.  One more thing.
What is it?
Never underestimate a monster.  They may look stupid but they can outwit you in seconds.
But they are animals right?  Just dumb beasts.
Er...yes, but even a dumb animal can have some low cunning.  A wolf  can play with you just as a troll can pick up a tree and beat you to death.
I think I get it then.  Thank you!

Uh. Menda Grandmaster.
Menda Karl.
I was just coming into see if there's anything I could do to help for the night.
Not really Karl.  I've shut up shop for the night.
I'll....I'll just be going now.
Ah, Stay awhile.  I could use the company.
Of course, Bataar...can I ask you a question?
You just did Karl, so yes, you can.
Ha...so Grandmaster, why did you end up here?  I noticed you have an accent but I don't recognize it.
Its because I'm a Varag.
Oh!  I'm sorry it doesn't sound like a Varag accent.
Its because I grew up almost fifty years ago.  Varags are very different now.
Fifty years ago? Then you grew up during the raiding age.  Did you, uh...come here on -
No I didn't come here on a raid.  I didn't have the stomach for it.
Oh.  Then why did you come here?  The ice-sheets?
No. It just wasn't my home and I wanted find where that was.  I took a ship to a little port called Yhomstad and got my first job.
Did you find that?
My path has brought me here twice, in the beginning and at the end.  So yes, I think I have.
I, uh, I hope you stay too....I've got one more question.
Go ahead?
Why did you choose to let me stay?  I'm not, Um, I wasn't at all worthy to serve under you.
Because once upon a time a village idiot bought a spear and crossed the Sea of Teeth, coming to a village named Yhomstad.
(Karl nods once, a small smile growing) Thank you, Grandmaster.

Grand Master! Caizen! It was incredible!  He held both of them off himself!
What do you mean boy?
We went to the Chovo frontier!  We came to the village of Goroda. We were stopping to eat and then out of nowhere a worm can tunneling out of the ground!
...
Caizen picked up his sabers and charged in.  Me and the others led the villagers out of the town.
Caizen...he-
He didn't make it.
...
Grand Master?
...
He drove them to the coast. I think I know where they went.
Karl.  Stay here.
Grand Master where are you-?
Karl, I have a secret to tell you.
W-what?
I did have a secret to fighting monsters.
What is it?
They are sapient.
What?
The monsters are sapient and I've known this.
But how.  You said they were dumb beasts...
I lied. They are fully self-aware. And have long memories.
Then...
Yes. They came for Caizen. And they are baiting me.
Then you won't go?
No.  I'm going now.
But you said they are-
Baiting me, yes. But I'm not going to let them kill anyone else.
I...alright.  Asena's fortune be with you!
