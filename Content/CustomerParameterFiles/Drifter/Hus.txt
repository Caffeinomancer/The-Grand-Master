Troll!  Troll! You have to help!
You are?
My name is Hus. Shepard Hus.
You have my ears.
There's a troll in the village square.
What?
A troll has made its way into Yhomstad! He has driven the people from their homes and now he is waiting in the square!
That's...that's peculiar behavior indeed.  I'll look into it.
Hurry!
