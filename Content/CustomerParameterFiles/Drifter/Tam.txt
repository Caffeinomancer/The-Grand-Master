Menda Grandmaster! I just wanted to talk before I go on my next quest. Could you teach me how to use that halberd? It's so impressive and I'm trying to decide on a style for my fighting, one like yours!
Haha, I'm sorry but not my personal halberd. Perhaps you can train with your own one day.
But yours is unique. GUNPOWDER? Explosions? Please?
You need to find your own style. Don't just mimic my own.
My own style? Huh. I don't know why my style is yet. Karl's? No, no. I'll have to think on that.
Alright then, I'll leave you for now. Goodbye, Grand Master.

Grand Master! Come! We need to go!
What are you planning, Tam?
I'm not planning anything. I just wanted you to come with me to the tavern!
Oh. No thank you Tam, I'd like to remain here.
I figured you wouldn't come if I told you where. Why can't you just hang out with me once in a while?
Don't you have a friend or family that could go with you?
I don't want anything bad to happen to Karl and well... my family is gone.
Ah. Died then?
Yes, a long time ago. When I cleared my home of monsters, it was for them. That place was long abandoned.
So I'll head to the tavern anyway then. I'll come by again soon. Don't forget, if you have a quest for me, don't hesitate to send me!

Menda. Can we talk for the moment?
I have time, what's wrong Tam?
I suppose nothing much is wrong but still, lets talk.
There was a man outside the tavern I went to. He was poking at people, prodding them, provoking them!
A couple people actually fought him and... he killed them. I was hoping you could handle the man.
Well, I could, but couldn't you? You could handle a drunken whelp after the quests I've given you.
You think I could? Should I kill him or not? I mean, he's a murderer.
Only if it comes to that, don't go in the fight intending to murder.
Of course Grand Master. I won't be like him. Thanks for the advice, good luck Grand Master.

Grandmaster.  Menda.
Menda. Pillars hold you up.
Have you ever wondered about those swords in the desert?
Giant made swords? Yes I have.
Where did the giants go?
They died off. Years ago.
Well...I was thinking, what if trolls were descended from them.
Pardon?
What if trolls are just the far off children of the giants and those swords...
Trolls are too small.
Wait! Bear with me!  We have dogs that descended from wolves and they are much smaller then those.
Are you suggesting trolls are dogs?
Well, no I...
Trolls are dumb beasts.  Nothing more.
But-
Don't think too deeply on this.
Oh.  Um. Alright.  I'll talk to you later.

Grandmaster! We found it!
What is the matter lass?
The worm in the godless waste!  Well...Karl did at least.
Karl tracked it?
Not exactly.  He got swallowed by it.
He got...swallowed?
Don't worry!  He's better now!  He got spit out!  
That's a relief.
But the worm.  It just watched us run.
Don't worry about that lass.  I'll handle it.
But sir, you are-
Old enough to have fought these things before.
Sir-
Wash up Karl.  I'll be back.
Yes sir!
