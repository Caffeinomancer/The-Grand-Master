Old Man! I come bearing great news!
A worm has been spotted, I assume? Well, go on then, I'm sure you can handle it.
No doubt, haha! But it's more than that; TWO Worms! A pair! One for me, and one for you! Glory all around, eh?
I'm intrigued. Where are we headed? 
Last I saw they were laying waste Pyren Farstad!
What?
Aye, and disrupting trade, no doubt. So if you need any more motivation, there it is! 
This is... troubling. Alright, you've convinced me. We're going Worm Hunting. 
Now that's what I like to hear!

Old Man! I come bearing great news!
Two worms! Two worms were spotted to the west! One for me, and one for you! Glory all around, eh?
And if that ain't enough for you, they were last seen laying waste to Pyren Farstad! And disrupting trade, no doubt! 
Now, how about you and me go Worm Hunting, eh?
