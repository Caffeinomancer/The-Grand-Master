You're not Knarr.
Clearly I'm not and who might you be?
How do you live in Yhomstad and not know me? I am Zalk Haamaar, son of Hul Haamaar Council Prince.
Council Prince?
You barbaroi. Here in Yhomstad we have a ruling Council and there are Princes in it.
Are you going to buy something or not? I have shop to manage.
I heard stories about you. Adventurer, mercenary, monster hunter. What's so grand about you? All I I see is a dusty shop with cheap trinkets run by an old man.
You are of no use to me. Firelock however. I want it, price is no issue.
Not for sale. I'll sell you any armor, weapon, or food you see here.
I grow tiresome of you. I wonder what Temu has on the top shelf today. I'l be back for that weapon if you change your mind.
