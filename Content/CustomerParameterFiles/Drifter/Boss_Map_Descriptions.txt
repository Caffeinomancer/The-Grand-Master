*Lava Worm - Tryggvar

I can not be at two places at one time. Tryggvar ran off to take on a worm by himself. Hope he is ready. I will take the grater challenge of the Lava Worm in the volcano.

*Frost Worm - Tam

Tam says Karl got caught in a worm maw but luckily made it out with his life. Other fools will soon accidentally stumble to their deaths. There is nobody else around but me to take care of it.

*Troll - Tryggvar

Farmer Hus spotted a stray Troll in the mountains. It was described as an older and very angry troll. Sounds like we have a little bit common, a shame I will have to put him down.

*Small Troll - Karl

Karl came in frantically yelling about a troll. I hear some knocking and thrashing outside the shop. I can not hear my own thoughts, guess I will handle it myself.

*Final Boss - Karl

Near Pyren Farstad is a coast held by monsters. All the locals and even Karl have observed from afar what appears to be a Troll and Worm working together. If rumors are true my worst fears have come to pass.
