(Rushes in, covered in burns) Grandmaster, do something! 
Loric?
Pyren Farstad...everyone is dead!  The troll...he...
That's impossible!  There was an entire garrison.  Even a troll couldn't kill that many people.
They waited until we shut the gate for the night!  He came out of the ground!  The fire worm came first, burrowing through the rock and the troll crawled out after him!  They were working together.
That's nonsense.  They are animals.  They couldn't plan-
I know what I saw!  I only escaped because I was on the other side of the gate.  Please! Do something!  There are still people there!
I'll...I'll do what I can.
I'll...I'll go tell the Elders!  Farewell, Grandmaster.
