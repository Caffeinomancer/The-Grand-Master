Tam: Grand Boss! We found it!
Grand Master: What is the matter lass?
Tam: The worm in the godless waste!  Well...Karl did at least.
Grand Master: Karl...tracking a worm? Successfully?
Tam: Well. Not exactly.  He got swallowed by it.
Grand Master: He got...swallowed?
Tam: Don't worry!  He's better now!  He got spit out!
Tam: He's just a wee bit dissolved. That's all. 
Grand Master: That's a pity.
Tam: But the worm.  It just watched us run.
Grand Master: Don't worry about that lass. Wash up Karl.  I'll be back.
Tam: Yes sir!

Grand Boss! We found it! The worm in the godless waste!
Well...Karl did at least. "Found"
He got swallowed by it.
Don't worry!  He's better now!  He got spit out!
He's just a wee bit dissolved. That's all.
