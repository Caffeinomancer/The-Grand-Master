"Grand Master! We were. Uh. Tracking the troll that attacked Pyren Farstad and you might want to hear this."

Karl:"We found the troll making camp near the coastline. It was standing next to a water...with a worm. It was like they were...talking."

Karl: "Grand Master, you told us that they...that they are dumb beasts...what does this mean?"

Grand Master: "It means I have some hunting to do."

Karl:"You...you said..."

Grand Master: "I know what I said Karl. And for everyone's sake you best repeat it. For now."
Grand Master:"Its my trade secret. But it seems like I can't keep it."

Karl: "Y-You knew?"

Grand Master: "I had my suspicions though. It doesn't matter now. I wish you all the best."

Grand Master: "Hopefully all three of you will be having this conversations with your successors."
