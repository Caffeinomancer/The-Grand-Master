Grandmaster! Please, you have to help us! 
Slow down, Karl. Tell me what's going on.
T-t-troll! There's a troll in the market!
What?
Th-there's a troll in Yhomstad! He's driven people from their homes and now he's just waiting in the square!
That is...that's peculiar behavior indeed. You were wise to come to me, I'll take care of it.
Hurry!

Grandmaster! There's a troll in the market! 
He drove everyone from the square and now he's just... standing there! He's crushing anyone who comes close! 
Please, you have to help us, nobody else knows how to fight such a creature!
