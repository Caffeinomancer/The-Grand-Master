Grandmaster! We found it!
What is the matter lass?
The worm in the godless waste!  Well...Karl did at least.
Karl tracked it?
Not exactly.  He got swallowed by it.
He got...swallowed?
Don't worry!  He's better now!  He got spit out!  
That's a relief.
But the worm.  It just watched us run.
Don't worry about that lass.  I'll handle it.
But sir, you are-
Old enough to have fought these things before.
Sir-
Wash up Karl.  I'll be back.
Yes sir!
