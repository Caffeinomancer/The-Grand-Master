$small toll
G-G-Grandmaster. There's a troll in the market!
He just came into the village!  He almost got me and Yngvar but I dived under some wagons and crawled here.
He drove everyone from the square and now he's just... standing there! Waiting. 
Pillars above! Say something man!
Please, you have to help.  I...I'll stay here and hide!
$big troll
Old Man! Farmer Hus asks for aid, says he has a troll problem. Again. 
Trudged its way down the mountainside, wandered into his crops. 
And I don't think the whelps could handle this one either. He's an old one; huge and angry! 
I'd do it myself but... well, I've got other prey in mind.
I'll let you take the glory for this kill. Hus says he last spotted it wandering out into the tundra.
$ice worm
Heya Grand Master! We found another worm in the Godless Waste!
It's been holding up all the caravan traffic to the Summit. Carts strewn about everywhere.
It sensed us but the worm...It just watched us run.
Being awfully cryptic today boss.  What'cha thinking?
(Awkward Pensive Silence)
Anyways, if you head out you could probably catch it in a day or two!
$fire worm
Old Man! I come bearing great news!
Two worms! Two worms were spotted to the west! One for me, and one for you! Glory all around, eh?
And if that ain't enough for you, they were last seen laying waste to Pyren Farstad! 
And disrupting trade, no doubt. Can't think of anything more motivating.
I'm going to be tracking that other beast.
Now, how about you and me go Worm Hunting, eh?
$final boss
Grand Master! We were tracking the troll that attacked Pyren Farstad and you might want to hear this.
We found the troll making camp near the coastline. It was standing next to a water...with a worm. It was like they were...talking.
Grand Master, do you...do you know anything about this? You are always so...so calm. Its like...
Pillars above, what if they know.
But we need you right now.  More then ever.
I'll...I'll tell the village if you don't return. Good hunting.
